A Rube Goldberg machine made in Box2D

By Pradyot Prakash, Chandra Maloo, Shantanu Thakoor

Our main goal is to use our Rube Goldberg Machine to shake the sleep out
of a person’s eyes! We basically turn off our alarms and the go back to sleep
again!
What if you had to attend an important lecture or a quiz? So our design
implements a very rudimentary model of a machine which hits the person with
several annoying elements after regular intervals of time. If (s)he is reluctant to
get up even then, we drop a bucket of water over her/him. If even that is not
enough, then we pull her/him up to the feet! Ya, that’s our way of doing it!
Let’s call our lazy friend, Deepali. Let us analyse the machine step by step.
Deepali, on hearing the alarm tries it turn it off and have some more sleep. She
pushes the rectangular bar on top of the alarm. The force disturbs the angular
sticks downwards and disturbs the equilibrium of the rectangular plank. So
some sort of chain reaction is triggered and all the magic happens! The planks
sinks in and pulls the vertical rod attached to it. It rod in turn rotates about the
horizontal support and hits the dominos, toppling them over. The interesting
part starts here onwards. The dominos excite the ball and it tries to resist
moving. But alas, the external force gives it momentum and it has to roll. The
ball reaches the edge and flies off into the air. We have put a vertical wall
to control the excitement which the ball contains. It collides and lands back
again on the lower plank. It then hits a pendulum, setting it into a swing. The
pendulum crosses its mean position and hits a ball on the other side. Meanwhile,
the former ball was continuing its journey and it falls on the incline plane to
go and hit Deepali on her head. It definitely gives her a sudden shock, but she
having spent a tough day the day before, ignores it.
Getting back to the original story. So the pendulum is on its way and hits
the smaller ball kept on the other horizontal slab. The ball lands up inside
the bucket. The bucket drops down and it pulls the bucket full of water as it
goes down. The bucket tilts and drops a crapload of water on Deepali. She
is definitely drenced to her skin but again due the party last night, she is still
unwilling to get ready for the lecture.
Being a true IITian, she had made a foolproof plan to get her to her feet. The
bucket which was falling continues to fall and hits the plank just below it. The
plank rotates and hits the plank above it. This irritates the ball kept on top
of it and it drops into the bucket below. Well this ball is very heavy and it
ultimately pulls the string to literally get Deepali on her feet!

We have set a basic timeline in our minds:
1• Following the midsem week, we will implement the person in our model.
2• We are planning on having several joints for the person:- for triggering
the alarm, and then we need to get him/her to his/her feet as well. This
may take some time, to get all the joints working fine and in sync. But
hopefully we will be able to get it right by the end of the week following
midsem week.
3• Tilting of the bucket may be a challenging task for us. It is because the
bucket contains many smaller balls and getting them to fall correctly on
the person, may not be so easy physically. This may require another week.
4• If the above task if finished on time, then we will require a couple of
weeks to finalize the other remaining pieces of the puzzle namely, getting
the person on its feet, the proper positioning of the smaller balls.
5• So basically we aim to finish the project by the mid week of October. As for
the work distribution, we will be doing the project as a team, and hence all the
members will be present while we work on it. The smaller bits will be done by
us depending on our convenience.
